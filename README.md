## 📜 History of Java

- **James Gosling** is the father of Java, and it was introduced in **1991**.
- The software was initially named **GreenTalk**, and the team that developed it was called the **Green Team**.
- Later, the software was renamed to **Oak**. Oak is a symbol of strength and is a national tree of Germany.
- Since there was already an existing company named **Oak Technologies**, legal issues arose. Due to this, the software name was changed from **Oak to Java**.
- James Gosling and his team once went for coffee on an island where the coffee shop was named **Java**. Hence, they named the software **Java**, and the **coffee cup** was chosen as the logo.
- Java is a **high-level programming language** originally developed by **Sun Microsystems** and released in **1995**.
- Java runs on various platforms such as **Windows, macOS, and different versions of UNIX**.

## 🧩 Tokens in Java

**Token** is the smallest unit of a Java program.

### Types of Tokens in Java:

1. Identifier  
2. Keywords  
3. Literals  
4. Operators  
5. Separators  
6. Comments  

---

## 1️⃣ Identifier

An **Identifier** is a name given to a Java program elements such as:
- Class name
- Method name
- Variable name

---

## 2️⃣ Keywords

**Keywords** are **pre-defined words** in Java that have a fixed meaning.

- Java contains **50 reserved keywords**
- Keywords cannot be used as identifiers

Example keywords:

## 🔑 Java Keywords (50)

|25 | import | 50 | while |

## 3️⃣ Literals in Java

**Literals** are fixed values that are used directly in Java programs.

### Types of Literals in Java

### 1️⃣ Number Literals
Used to represent numeric values.

- **Integer Literals**  
  Examples: `9`, `8`, `7`, `6`, `5`

- **Decimal (Floating-Point) Literals**  
  Examples: `0.55`, `0.75`

---

### 2️⃣ Character Literals
- Enclosed within **single quotes (`' '`)**
- Represent a single character

Examples:
'A', '5', '$', ' '

## 4. Operators in Java

Operators are symbols used to perform operations on operands.
